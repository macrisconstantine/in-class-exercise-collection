# in-class-exercise-collection
This is a little library of various mini programming exercises mostly from classes early in my undergraduate.

### Ceasar Cypher
- This exercise manipulates a user-input string by shifting the letters to create a simple sort of encryption.
### Command Line
- This exercise is just an intro to sending command line arguments to a C program.
