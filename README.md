This is a little library of various mini programming exercises mostly from classes early in my undergraduate.

### Ceasar Cypher
- This exercise manipulates a user-input string by shifting the letters to create a simple encryption.
### Command Line
- This exercise is just an intro to sending command-line arguments to a C program.
### Distance Between Points, Converting Seconds, and Tax Calculator
- This homework assignment consisted of three exercises.
- The first calculates distance between to points plotted on cartesian coordinates.
- The second converts input seconds to hours, minutes, and remaining seconds.
- The third calculates tax of an individual and their spouse.
### Exponent
- Takes user input to raise a given number to a given exponent.
### Pointers

### If Grade
- Input a score (out of 100) and recieve a letter-grade and comment. 
### Income Tax
- Input an annual salary, recieve a net salary after tax.
### Least Common Denominator
- Return both the least common denominatory and the greatest common factor of command line inputs.
### Malloc Practice
- Command-line input summed to practice and demonstrate pointers.
### Min, Max, Sum
- Input a series of integers through the command line, and return the min, max, and average of the numbers.
### Peaches
- Calculate the cost of peaches by dividing the cost by the quantity to find the cost/peach.
### Realloc Function Practice
- A demonstrative script that lets you input values in the command-line and see the actual memory addresses used to store the values.
### Secretize
- Takes an input word and secretizes it by replacing all letters except the first and last with a blank.
### Show Primes
- Shows prime numbers within a given range.
### Calculate Tax
- Very simple C script to calculate the tax on an input income figure.
